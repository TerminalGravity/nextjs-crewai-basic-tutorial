This document outlines the structure of the Home page in a user-friendly manner, without the use of programming syntax.

The Home page is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, featuring a clean white background with text in black for easy readability. The layout is divided into two main sections, each taking up half of the screen width, ensuring a balanced and organized presentation.

On the left side, users are greeted with input sections for adding companies and positions. These sections are clearly labeled "Companies" and "Positions," with placeholders prompting the user to "Add a company" or "Add a position," respectively. This design allows users to easily input and manage the data related to companies and positions they are interested in.

The right side of the page is dedicated to displaying the output and event logs. At the top, there's a bold heading labeled "Output," under which there's a button that users can click to start the job. This button is styled in a vibrant green color that changes to a darker shade upon hovering, with white text that reads "Start" or "Running..." depending on the job's status, indicating whether the process is active or not. This interactive element enhances user engagement by providing a clear call to action.

Below the button, the final output of the position information list is displayed, followed by an event log that records and shows all events. This section is designed to provide users with real-time feedback and results from their input, making the process transparent and informative.

Overall, the Home page combines functionality with aesthetics, offering a user-friendly interface for managing and viewing company and position data, as well as the outcomes of the job processes initiated by the user.
