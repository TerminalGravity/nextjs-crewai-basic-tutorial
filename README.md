   - Once the research is complete, the `FinalOutput` and `EventLog` components display the main findings and a log of events, respectively, showcasing the insights gathered by Crew AI.


```39:46:nextjs_app/hooks/useCrewJob.tsx
    const fetchJobStatus = async () => {
      try {
        console.log("calling fetchJobStatus");
        const response = await axios.get<{
          status: string;
          result: { positions: PositionInfo[] };
          events: EventType[];
        }>(`http://localhost:3001/api/crew/${currentJobId}`);
```


5. **Backend Communication**:
   - The Flask backend handles communication with Crew AI, managing the initiation, processing, and completion of research jobs.
   - It responds to frontend requests with the current status, results, and event logs of the research job.

This implementation showcases how Crew AI's capabilities are harnessed to automate market research tasks, with the Next.js frontend facilitating user interaction and the Flask backend managing the research process.

The application leverages Crew AI to automate market research tasks, providing users with insights into companies and positions of interest.

This setup ensures users receive detailed insights and real-time updates on their market research tasks, leveraging the capabilities of Crew AI to automate the process efficiently.

### Frontend Components:

#### 1. **InputSection**:
- **Purpose**: Allows users to input companies and positions they're interested in researching.
- **Interaction with Flask**:
  - Users enter their desired companies and positions into form fields.
  - Upon submitting the form (typically via a "Start" button), the `InputSection` component triggers a function (e.g., `startJob`) defined in the [useCrewJob](file:///Users/jackfelke/Repos/nextjs-crewai-basic-tutorial/nextjs_app/components/EventLog.tsx#3%2C36-3%2C36) hook.
  - This function sends a POST request to the Flask backend, including the companies and positions as the payload. The Flask server receives this request at a specific endpoint (e.g., `/api/start_job`) and initiates the research process.
  - The backend then responds with a job ID, which the frontend uses to track the progress of the research job.

#### 2. **FinalOutput** and **EventLog**:
- **Purpose**: Display the results of the research job and log events or updates from the backend, respectively.
- **Interaction with Flask**:
  - Both components rely on the [useCrewJob](file:///Users/jackfelke/Repos/nextjs-crewai-basic-tutorial/nextjs_app/components/EventLog.tsx#3%2C36-3%2C36) hook, which polls the backend for updates using the job ID.
  - The [useCrewJob](file:///Users/jackfelke/Repos/nextjs-crewai-basic-tutorial/nextjs_app/components/EventLog.tsx#3%2C36-3%2C36) hook periodically sends GET requests to an endpoint (e.g., `/api/job_status/<job_id>`) to fetch the latest job status, results, and event logs.
  - The Flask backend processes these requests, querying the database or in-memory data structure where job statuses and results are stored.
  - The backend then sends back the requested data, which the frontend displays in the `FinalOutput` and [EventLog](file:///Users/jackfelke/Repos/nextjs-crewai-basic-tutorial/nextjs_app/components/EventLog.tsx#10%2C14-10%2C14) components.

#### 3. **useCrewJob Hook**:
- **Purpose**: Manages the state and logic for interacting with the Flask backend, including starting jobs, polling for updates, and storing results and events.
- **Interaction with Flask**:
  - **Starting Jobs**: Sends POST requests to initiate research jobs and receives a job ID for tracking.
  - **Polling for Updates**: Uses the job ID to send periodic GET requests, fetching job status, results, and event logs.
  - **Handling Responses**: Processes the data received from the backend, updating the frontend state to reflect the latest job progress, results, and events.

### Flask Backend:

The Flask server acts as the intermediary between the frontend and the data sources or processing logic required for the research jobs. It handles requests from the frontend, performs the necessary data aggregation or processing, and returns the results.

- **Receiving Job Requests**: A Flask route (e.g., `/api/start_job`) accepts POST requests from the frontend, extracts the companies and positions from the request body, and initiates the research process.
- **Processing Jobs**: The backend may use asynchronous tasks (e.g., with Celery) to perform the research in the background, allowing the Flask server to remain responsive.
- **Storing and Retrieving Job Data**: The backend maintains a database or in-memory data structure to store the status, results, and event logs of each job. This data is updated as the job progresses.
- **Sending Updates to Frontend**: For each GET request received from the frontend (e.g., to `/api/job_status/<job_id>`), the Flask server queries the stored job data and returns the latest information to the frontend.

This detailed interaction ensures that the frontend components can effectively start research jobs, display results and updates, and provide a dynamic user experience, all while the Flask backend efficiently processes the research tasks and manages the data.
