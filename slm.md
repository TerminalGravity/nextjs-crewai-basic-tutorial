Expanding the output options of your application can significantly enhance user experience by providing more comprehensive insights and allowing users to interact with the data in various ways. Here are some suggestions to consider for offering more output options:

### 1. **Downloadable Reports**:
Allow users to download the research findings as PDF or CSV files. This can be particularly useful for users who need to share insights with colleagues or reference the data offline. Implementing this feature might involve generating documents on the server side based on the research results and then providing a download link to the user.

### 2. **Interactive Data Visualizations**:
Incorporate interactive charts and graphs to visualize the research findings. Libraries like Chart.js or D3.js can be used to create dynamic visualizations that users can interact with, such as filtering views or drilling down into specific data points. This approach can make the data more accessible and engaging.

### 3. **Customizable Dashboards**:
Offer users the ability to customize how they view their research findings by selecting which data points to display or hide. This could involve creating a dashboard where users can add, remove, or rearrange widgets displaying different aspects of the research results.

### 4. **Real-time Notifications**:
For long-running research tasks, consider implementing real-time notifications (e.g., via email or SMS) to inform users when their research job is complete or if there are important updates. This feature can improve the user experience by keeping users informed without requiring them to continuously check the application.

### 5. **API Access to Data**:
Provide an API endpoint that allows users or external systems to retrieve research findings programmatically. This can be useful for users who wish to integrate the research data into their own systems or workflows.

### 6. **Integration with Third-party Tools**:
Enable integration with popular third-party tools like Slack, Trello, or Google Sheets, allowing users to export their findings directly to these platforms. This can streamline workflows for users who rely on these tools for project management or collaboration.

### Implementation Considerations:
- **Security and Privacy**: Ensure that any feature involving data export or sharing complies with data protection regulations and safeguards user privacy.
- **Performance**: Consider the impact of these features on your application's performance, especially for data-intensive operations like generating reports or visualizations. Implementing asynchronous processing or optimizing data queries can help mitigate performance issues.
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface for these features, ensuring that users can easily access and utilize the new output options without confusion.

By expanding the output options, you can provide a richer, more versatile experience for your users, encouraging deeper engagement with the application and its insights.
